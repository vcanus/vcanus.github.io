## VCANUS EdgeAI Solutions for Smart Manufacturing

VCANUS provides cutting-edge EdgeAI solutions powered by TSLoom and advanced data analytics, enabling manufacturers to achieve real-time process intelligence, predictive maintenance, and data-driven decision-making. Our solutions leverage machine learning, time-series analysis, and edge computing to optimize production processes, reduce downtime, and enhance quality‚Äîall while ensuring scalability, low latency, and seamless integration with existing systems.

## Why VCANUS EdgeAI?

VCANUS empowers manufacturers to:

- Predict process outcomes with high accuracy using time-series data.
- Classify and cluster production patterns for deeper insights and efficiency.
- Detect anomalies in real time to prevent defects and minimize waste.
- Deploy lightweight, high-performance AI models directly on edge devices for low-latency decision-making.
- Integrate seamlessly with industrial IoT (IIoT) and MES/ERP systems.

Unlike traditional analytics tools, our solutions are tailored for industrial environments, delivering actionable insights at the edge where data is generated.

## Key Solutions

### 1. Process Prediction
- Forecast critical process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, cycle time) using TSLoom-based time-series models.
- Optimize production schedules by predicting bottlenecks and resource demands.
- Improve yield and reduce scrap with data-driven recommendations.
### Use Cases:
- Predictive quality control in semiconductor, automotive, and metal fabrication.
- Energy consumption optimization in manufacturing lines.


### 2. Classification & Clustering
- Classify production states (e.g., normal vs. abnormal operation) for automated quality control.
- Cluster similar process patterns to identify hidden inefficiencies or optimal conditions.
- Enable root-cause analysis by grouping similar anomalies or defects.
### Use Cases:
- Defect classification in PCB assembly, casting, and additive manufacturing.
- Process optimization in chemical and pharmaceutical production.


### 3. Anomaly Detection
- Real-time anomaly detection using unsupervised and supervised learning models.
- Early warning system for equipment failures, reducing unplanned downtime.
- Adaptive thresholds that learn from historical data to minimize false alarms.
### Use Cases:
- Fault detection in rotating machinery, pumps, and CNC tools.
- Quality monitoring in food & beverage, packaging, and electronics.


### 4. EdgeAI Deployment
- Lightweight AI models optimized for edge devices (e.g., PLCs, industrial PCs, gateways).
- Low-latency inference for real-time decision-making without cloud dependency.
- Secure and scalable deployment across multiple production sites.
### Technologies:
- TSLoom: Time-series optimization for industrial data.
- Federated Learning: Privacy-preserving model training across distributed sites.
- Containerized AI: Easy deployment via Docker/Kubernetes.

### Hot It Works
