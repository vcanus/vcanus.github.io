## VCANUS EdgeAI Solutions for Smart Manufacturing

VCANUS delivers cutting-edge EdgeAI solutions, powered by TSLoom and advanced data analytics, to enable manufacturers to achieve real-time process intelligence, predictive maintenance, and data-driven decision-making. Our solutions combine machine learning, time-series analysis, and edge computing to optimize production processes, reduce downtime, and enhance qualityâ€”while ensuring scalability, low latency, and seamless integration with existing systems.

## Why VCANUS EdgeAI?

VCANUS empowers manufacturers to:

- Predict process outcomes with high accuracy using time-series data.
- Classify and cluster production patterns for deeper insights and efficiency.
- Detect anomalies in real time to prevent defects and minimize waste.
- Deploy lightweight, high-performance AI models directly on edge devices for low-latency decision-making.
- Integrate seamlessly with industrial IoT (IIoT) and MES/ERP systems.

Unlike traditional analytics tools, our solutions are tailored for industrial environments, delivering actionable insights at the edge where data is generated.

## Key Solutions

### 1. Process Prediction
- Forecast critical process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, cycle time) using TSLoom-based time-series models.
- Optimize production schedules by predicting bottlenecks and resource demands.
- Improve yield and reduce scrap with data-driven recommendations.
<br>
> Use Cases:
>    + Predictive quality control in semiconductor, automotive, and metal fabrication.
>    + Energy consumption optimization in manufacturing lines.


### 2. Classification & Clustering
- Classify production states (e.g., normal vs. abnormal operation) for automated quality control.
- Cluster similar process patterns to identify hidden inefficiencies or optimal conditions.
- Enable root-cause analysis by grouping similar anomalies or defects.
<br>
> Use Cases:
>    + Defect classification in PCB assembly, casting, and additive manufacturing.
>    + Process optimization in chemical and pharmaceutical production.


### 3. Anomaly Detection
- Real-time anomaly detection using unsupervised and supervised learning models.
- Early warning system for equipment failures, reducing unplanned downtime.
- Adaptive thresholds that learn from historical data to minimize false alarms.
<br>
> Use Cases:
>    + Fault detection in rotating machinery, pumps, and CNC tools.
>    + Quality monitoring in food & beverage, packaging, and electronics.


### 4. EdgeAI Deployment
- Lightweight AI models optimized for edge devices (e.g., PLCs, industrial PCs, gateways).
- Low-latency inference for real-time decision-making without cloud dependency.
- Secure and scalable deployment across multiple production sites.
<br>
> Technologies:
>    + TSLoom: Time-series optimization for industrial data.
>    + Federated Learning: Privacy-preserving model training across distributed sites.
>    + Containerized AI: Easy deployment via Docker/Kubernetes.

## How It Works
