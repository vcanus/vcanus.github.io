## VCANUS 3D Measurement Solutions for Smart Manufacturing

Custom Robotic Scanning. Data-Driven Insights.

VCANUS provides tailored 3D measurement solutions by integrating Zeiss ATOS optical scanners with robotic automation and VURT-X for fully automated, high-efficiency dimensional analysis. Unlike standard fixed systems like Zeiss ScanBox, we deliver custom robotic setups optimized for your production environment, enabling seamless digitalization of part geometries and AI-powered statistical analysis of measurement data.
Our solutions combine Zeiss ATOS scanners with VCANUSâ€™s robotic expertise and advanced software, allowing manufacturers to capture precise 3D data, analyze dimensional variations, and make data-driven decisions for process optimizationâ€”without the constraints of traditional measurement systems.

## Why VCANUS 3D Measurement?

VCANUS empowers manufacturers to:
- Digitize complex part geometries using Zeiss ATOS scanners mounted on industrial robots or cobots.
- Automate measurement workflows with VURT-X, eliminating manual intervention and reducing cycle times.
- Analyze measurement data with statistical tools and AI models to identify trends, correlations, and process deviations.
- Apply production-specific tolerances to automatically classify parts based on predefined control limits.
- Integrate seamlessly with MES, ERP, and CAD systems for closed-loop quality management.

Unlike conventional systems, VCANUS focuses on customization, automation, and data intelligenceâ€”delivering actionable insights from 3D measurement data.

> + Aerospace: Airfoils, structural components, and tooling validation.
> + Energy: Turbine blades, impellers, and large fabricated parts.

### 2. AI & Statistical Analysis Software

VCANUS provides advanced software tools to transform raw 3D data into actionable insights:

- Tolerance-Based Classification:
    + Apply production-specific tolerances to automatically classify parts as within/outside control limits.
    + Generate pass/fail reports based on positional tolerances (e.g., GD&T).
- Statistical Process Control (SPC):
    + Track dimensional variations over time to detect trends, shifts, or drifts.
    + Correlate measurement data with process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure) to identify root causes.
- AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:
    + Use machine learning models to detect unexpected patterns in measurement data.
    + Predict potential issues before they affect production quality.
> Example Workflow (Automotive Mass Production):
>   + 1. Scan: Robot-mounted ATOS captures 3D data of a car body panel.
>   + 2. Align: Software aligns scan data to CAD nominals.
>   + 3. Analyze:
>       . Compare measurements against management tolerances (e.g., Â±0.2 mm for critical features).
>       . Apply statistical models to assess process stability.
>   + 4. Report:
>       . Automated reports highlight areas exceeding tolerances.
>       . Dashboards visualize trends and deviations for process engineers.
>   + 5. Act:
>       . Adjust production parameters (e.g., fixture settings, machining paths) based on data.
