## VCANUS Custom Robotic Measurement Solutions

### 1. Robot-Mounted 3D Scanning

1) Flexible Automation:
- Mount ATOS scanners on 6-axis robots or cobots for adaptive scanning of complex parts.
- Custom fixturing ensures repeatable positioning and full coverage of part surfaces.
2) VURT-X Integration:
- Automated path planning for optimal scan coverage.
- Collision avoidance and adaptive scanning for varying part geometries.
> Use Cases:
> + Automotive: Body panels, chassis components, and assembly verification.
> + Aerospace: Airfoils, structural components, and tooling validation.
> + Energy: Turbine blades, impellers, and large fabricated parts.

### 2. AI & Statistical Analysis Software

VCANUS provides advanced software tools to transform raw 3D data into actionable insights:

1) Tolerance-Based Classification:
- Apply production-specific tolerances to automatically classify parts as within/outside control limits.
- Generate pass/fail reports based on positional tolerances (e.g., GD&T).
2) Statistical Process Control (SPC):
- Track dimensional variations over time to detect trends, shifts, or drifts.
- Correlate measurement data with process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure) to identify root causes.
3) AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:
- Use machine learning models to detect unexpected patterns in measurement data.
- Predict potential issues before they affect production quality.
> Example Workflow (Automotive Mass Production):
>   1) Scan: Robot-mounted ATOS captures 3D data of a car body panel.
>   2) Align: Software aligns scan data to CAD nominals.
>   3) Analyze:
>       <br>
>       . Compare measurements against management tolerances (e.g., Â±0.2 mm for critical features).
>       <br>
>       . Apply statistical models to assess process stability.
>   4) Report:
>       <br>
>       . Automated reports highlight areas exceeding tolerances.
>       <br>
>       . Dashboards visualize trends and deviations for process engineers.
>   5) Act:
>       <br>
>       . Adjust production parameters (e.g., fixture settings, machining paths) based on data.
