## VCANUS Universal Robot Transformation - X

VURT-X is a universal robot transformation platform designed for virtual simulation and direct real-time control of industrial and collaborative robots. By replacing manual teaching processes and eliminating traditional robot code, VURT-X enables faster deployment, greater flexibility, and simplified automation through intuitive sequence management and direct GUI-based operation.
VURT-X provides a unified platform to manage multiple robot brands—such as KUKA, Stäubli, FANUC, ABB, and Rainbow Robotics—through a single, common interface, removing the need for brand-specific programming. Additionally, VURT-X integrates Beckhoff PLC functionality, enabling seamless I/O signal control (e.g., lamps, switches, buttons) essential for automation systems.
For manufacturers managing diverse robot fleets, VURT-X reduces setup time, minimizes programming complexity, and enhances operational efficiency, making robot deployment and management more systematic and cost-effective.

## Why Is a Universal Robot Transformation Needed?

Traditional robot programming relies on teach pendants and manual coding, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and inflexible. This approach not only delays deployment but also increases maintenance efforts, especially when managing multiple robots.
VURT-X solves these challenges by:
- Eliminating manual teaching through direct GUI-based control.
- Removing traditional robot code with automated sequence management.
- Enabling virtual simulation for path verification and collision detection.
- Providing real-time monitoring and 3D visualization for precise operation and diagnostics.
By replacing fragmented, brand-dependent workflows with a unified and scalable solution, VURT-X accelerates deployment, reduces engineering overhead, and improves productivity.

## What You Can Do with VURT-X

With VURT-X, users can:
- Simulate and verify motion paths and detect collisions in a virtual environment.
- Operate robots directly via an intuitive GUI, without teach pendants.
- Synchronize robot and external system movements for coordinated, high-precision tasks.
- Monitor robot status in real time with 3D visualization.
- Create, simulate, and execute sequences—including point-to-point motion and custom tasks (e.g., pick-and-place, inspection, packaging, labeling).
- Program and utilize an embedded PLC for advanced automation logic.

## Key Features
