## Real-Time Data & AI Platform for Industries and Beyond
 
TSLoom is a high-performance data processing and MLOps platform designed to enable real-time analytics and machine learning on streaming data. By leveraging distributed control, containerization, and automated workflows, TSLoom simplifies the deployment, management, and integration of ML modelsâ€”empowering industries and innovators to transform raw data into actionable insights.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that combines machine learning, data engineering, and IT operations to automate and optimize the entire ML lifecycleâ€”from data collection and model training to deployment and continuous monitoring. It accelerates model development, ensures operational reliability, and enables scalable, seamless deployment in both industrial and general applications.
TSLoom provides comprehensive end-to-end MLOps capabilities, making it easier to operationalize and scale ML solutionsâ€”whether for factories, smart cities, or custom applications.
