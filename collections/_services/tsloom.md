# Real-time MLOps Platform
 
TSLoom은 머신러닝 모델을 기반으로 실시간으로 수집되는 데이터를 처리하고 분석할 수 있는 데이터 처리 및 분석 플랫폼입니다.

TSLoom은 MLOps 플랫폼으로서 쉽게 데이터 분석 모델을 배포하고 관리할 수 있으며, 분산 제어 및 컨테이너 기술을 통해 고객사의 시스템과 빠르게 연계할 수 있습니다.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps는 머신러닝(Machine Learning)과 운영(Operations)의 합성어로, 데이터 수집부터 머신러닝 모델의 학습 및 개발, 머신러닝 모델의 배포 및 관리까지 전 과정을 통합하고 자동화하는 패러다임입니다.

## What you can do with TSLoom

The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.

> As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

## Key Features

A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized to aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites.

## Process

There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page.

- User experience research
- Visual design and illustration
- Programming and coding

Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.
