# Industrial Real-Time Data & AI Platform
 
TSLoom is an industrial-grade data processing and MLOps platform designed to enable real-time analytics and machine learning on streaming data. By leveraging distributed control, containerization, and automated workflows, TSLoom simplifies the deployment, management, and integration of ML models—empowering industries to transform raw data into actionable insights.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that combines machine learning, data engineering, and IT operations to automate and optimize the entire ML lifecycle—from data collection and model training to deployment and continuous monitoring. It speeds up model development, ensures operational reliability, and enables scalable, seamless deployment in production environments.
TSLoom provides comprehensive end-to-end MLOps capabilities, making it easier to operationalize and scale ML solutions.
